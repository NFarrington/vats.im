            <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
            <p>VATS.IM was created as a free service to make posting long URLs easier, and may only be used for actual
                URLs. Using it for spamming or illegal purposes is forbidden and any such use will result in the URL
                being disabled and any involved parties being reported to the relevant organisations or authorities,
                potentially including, but not limited to, all involved ISPs, and any appropriate governmental agencies.
                This service is provided without warranty of any kind.</p>

            <p>VATS.IM is primarily intended for the use of VATSIM members, and for linking to VATSIM-related content.
                VATS.IM reserves the right to modify and/or remove any content at any time.</p>

            <h2>General Use</h2>
            <p>Please do not create identical URLs across multiple domains. Allow other users the opportunity to use the
                same short URL on a different domain.</p>

            <p>Use your best judgement to avoid abusing or misusing the service. The creation of an excessive number of
                URLs to reserve names or prevent other users from benefiting from the service may lead to the URLs being
                removed, and the account suspended.</p>

            <h2>Spam, Malware, and Phishing</h2>
            <p>Do not direct users to sites containing spam and malware. Spam sites include those that are low quality,
                made for advertisements or consist solely of low value content. Malware sites include sites that
                transmit content which may harm or interfere with the operation of other networks, servers, or other
                infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Do not direct users to sites engaged in phishing. Phishing sites solicit or collect sensitive data,
                including but not limited to passwords, financial details, and social security numbers.</p>

            <p>Do not direct users to URLs that contain only IP addresses.</p>

            <p>If you believe that a URL is violating the spam, malware, or phishing policies, <a
                        href="mailto:abuse@vats.im">report abuse</a>.</p>

            <h2>Child Exploitation</h2>
            <p>Do not direct users to content that exploits or abuses children. This includes all child sexual abuse
                imagery (including cartoon images) and all content that presents children in a sexual manner. You cannot
                direct users to sites that create, possess, or distribute child sexual abuse imagery.</p>

            <p>We will remove such content and take appropriate action, which may include disabling accounts and
                reporting to appropriate authorities, including law enforcement.</p>

            <p>If you believe that a URL is violating the child exploitation policies, <a href="mailto:abuse@vats.im">report
                    abuse</a>.</p>

            <h2>Personal and Confidential Information</h2>
            <p>Do not direct users to sites which publish people's private and confidential information, such as credit
                card numbers, Social Security numbers, drivers and other license numbers, or any other information that
                is not publicly accessible. Keep in mind that in most cases, information that is already available
                elsewhere on the Internet or in public records is not considered to be private or confidential under our
                policies.</p>

            <p>If you believe that a URL is violating the personal and confidential information policy, <a
                        href="mailto:abuse@vats.im">report abuse</a>.</p>

            <h2>Violence and Other Extremist Content</h2>
            <p>Do not direct users to sites that recruit, fundraise for, or promote violence or terrorism. Do not direct
                users to sites that include extremely graphic or violent material for the purpose of disgusting viewers
                or glorifying those engaged in violence.</p>

            <p>If you believe that a URL is violating the violence and other extremist content policy, <a
                        href="mailto:abuse@vats.im">report abuse</a>.</p>

            <h2>Copyright</h2>
            <p>To report copyright infringement, <a href="mailto:abuse@vats.im">report abuse</a>.</p>

            <h2>Policy Changes</h2>
            <p>From time to time we may update this policy. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the
                new policy on the website. Your continued usage of VATS.IM constitutes an acceptance of the then-current
                policies, including the Terms of Use, so we encourage you to visit this page periodically to review any
                changes.</p>
